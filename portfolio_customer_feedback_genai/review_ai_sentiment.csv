I was once given a ProntoTec 7&#34; tablet and it was so useless, I was put off on tablets altogether. But the Kindle Fire actually works, and works well. It's quick, responds accurately to my touch, and makes an excellent Kindle ebook reader. I've been reading like crazy since I got it. It also performs fine for simple things like checking email and getting notices from my gmail calendar. For other uses, like games, or anything that involves text input, I'd rather be at my desktop with a big screen and good keyboard. That's not a knock on the Fire, it's just my preference. The point is that I haven't been downloading apps and using them. Other than sitting in my easy chair and reading, I can't think of anything I'd rather do on a tablet than on a desktop PC.<br /><br />I once read that Amazon sells the Kindles at below cost in the hope the buyers will spend money on the books, movies, videos, subscription services, etc. I don't know if that is true, but really, a tablet isn't of any value without the content, so any review of the Kindle Fire must address that. I have enjoyed my free trials of both Amazon Prime and Kindle Unlimited (KU). Both are paid services that give you privileges and &#34;free&#34; stuff (that you are paying for with your subscription). I have decided to cancel both at the end of the free trial period next week. I'm not saying they aren't worth it. I've found a couple of good TV series on Amazon Prime (Bosch, Sneaky Pete) and read some good books from KU. But after checking my reading wish list against the KU offerings, I find that most of them are available on Kindle for money, but are not in the KU or Prime catalog. So I would still have to pay for them. Similarly, the best movies on Amazon video are not included in Prime. So despite paying for these free downloads and streams through the subscription, I'd still pay full retail on top of that. I don't see the point of the subscriptionif that holds true. I've downloaded the Overdrive app so I can get some of these ebooks from my local library. I'll try that for awhile. I'll also check out the free books that are always being offered on Amazon and see how good or bad they are. I may go back to KU after I've compared that experience. And I may just start buying Kindle books without the subscriptions services. I really like the Kindle for book reading.<br /><br />Your needs and tastes may vary. I just urge you to consider how you're going to use the Kindle. The Fire does not allow access to the Google app store downloads. You have to get your apps from Amazon's store. Many are free, but you can't necessarily get the ones you would like that are available for Android phones and tablets. Also, this model is wi-fi only, so it's not connected using the cell service data plans. That works for me because I don't take it out of the house, but you may want to spring for something more expensive if you need to be always connected.",2015-08-30,1,"1"

The phone app is okay in a reading emergency, but I find it is not quite heavy enough to wake me up when it hits me in the face if I have fallen asleep while reading ;)  So, my newest Fire gets 5 stars because finally the designers were thinking like actual Kindle users by putting the power button at the top of the device instead of at the bottom where it was too easy to accidentally power cycle.

(bigger number next to GB  is better as well. )<br /><br />2. No youtube/ google play services: while some may like this, and some may not, I do wish for google play services but, I also wish for amazon to keep it's current os look. HOWEVER: you can run .apks (android apps) on this device, as long as you're willing to accept that amazon WILL NOT HELP YOU should an android .apk causes internal system damage to your fire.<br /><br />3. keyboard lag: Remember the 200 MBs of RAM that you are left to fart around with? I forgot to factor in keyboard usage,  after keyboard usage, 100 MB, and this causes some slow downs, in terms of the keyboard, and some other amazon apps and services.<br /><br />and these are really the only complaints I have with the device, on the scale of dream about it, play with a store display unit, or buy it?

Before the update it would automatically load whichever profile was loaded when it shut down.  This change is causing a good deal of frustration with the toddler who used to be able to power it on and get into his profile with very little assistance.<br />Also, I purchased the full version of some preschool apps, but they cannot be used in the child's profile because it does not allow for in-app purchases.  While Amazon was willing to refund my money for the apps, their first response was to allow the child to use the apps in the parent's profile.  I felt that defeated the purpose of parental controls.  My husband and I use a Samsung tablet.  When we upgrade our tablet we're going to give our old one to the kids because the Samsung Kid's Mode app is more user-friendly--it allows in-app purchases to be used in Kid's mode and if the tablet shuts down in kid's mode, it reboots in kid's mode.",2015-08-25,0,"-1"

I bought it to replace a Nexus 7 (original gen) that was getting on in years.  That was a mistake.  The Fire HD 7, while providing a nice screen, is very frustrating to deal with when you're coming from a more versatile system.  To be clear, the only things I really do on these devices is: 1) read books; 2) watch movies/shows on channel specific or general apps like Hulu, Netflix, Showtime, etc.; 3) occasionally browse the web; and 4) occasionally play games.  For these simple purposes, the Fire is okay, but barely.  Because it's a closed system, you can only download apps from Amazon, who doesn't have the full complement of apps available on Google Play.  You can root the Fire, but that's way more work than should be necessary for something like this.<br /><br />Then there's the battery life, which is horrible.  I now rarely use the Fire because it always needs to be charged.  I can have it fully charged, read something on it for 30 minutes, put it down for a day, and come back to find it's out of juice.  My old Nexus 7 doesn't even eat battery like that!  That makes this thing an occasional device to use after my Nexus runs down.  Added to that, despite its use of the universal Micro USB, it only seems to charge on its own cord, which makes meet think it's poorly constructed to boot.<br /><br />Bottom line: I regret wasting my money on this and will not be buying again, or recommending to anyone else to purchase unless it's super cheap.",2015-08-20,0,"-1"

Seriously though, the ads are super annoying and I don't understand why not people aren't complaining about them. Amazon fail.   So far this is a pretty awesome tablet/e-reader.

I've had it since November 2014. The screen cracked today. I called into Amazon, and was told that they would not replace or fix my Kindle Fire. I asked them why does the commercial say that the Kindle Fire can withstand G-Forces, but not a drop of less than 2 feet. When I told the representative, Melissa, that, she got smart with me. I asked to speak to her manager, and she said that she could not contact a manager, but she could contact a supervisor. (Same thing.) When the manager, Ryan, got on the phone, he apologized that my screen was cracked, but he would still not replace or fix my Kindle Fire. We asked for his supervisor, and were told Jeff Bezos, but they had no way of contacting him. I've had this Kindle Fire for less than a year. This is the first thing to happen to it. I do not believe that they should state that the Kindle Fire can withstand G-Forces, when obviously it cannot. I am very disappointed not only with Amazon's response, but with the attitude of the phone representatives. I was never informed that there was an accident insurance plan, but I wouldn't have been, since they are all third party. (I also wouldn't have thought to buy one, since they are supposed to be able to withstand G-forces.)",2015-08-18,0,"-1"

Logging on from the lock screen is also sluggish where after i put in my pass pin there is a good 1 second lag where i am often unsure if there was an &#34;enter&#34; or &#34;ok&#34; button i forgot to press. Performance within apps are no problem, once an app is loaded it runs smoothly from books, to games, to movies.<br /><br />-Battery: (Fair) battery is tied to hardware but warrants its own section Battery life leaves much to be desired, my daughter plays on apps and watches videos (too young to read yet) and the battery will last for ~4-5 hours, which is plenty if you are using it in the house but if you are going to be flying then it can fall a little short sometimes.<br /><br />-Kindle operating system (OS): (Excellent/poor):<br /><br />-- Part 1 [main system]: (poor) it doesn't run like anything that most people are used to. I have used and am very comfortable with both iOS (apple) and Android. the main idea with those is to have a few apps on the bottom with a library in the middle. the kindle makes it different where there are large &#34;recent history&#34; apps which side scroll in the middle. then on the bottom there is another row of &#34;favorites&#34; on the bottom. with a swipe up from the bottom tray you can access all of the apps you choose to have there, (like a hidden home screen). The search function is also mainly geared towards finding things on amazon and makes anything that is on the store come up first.<br /><br />--Part 2 [Free time]: (Excellent) this is the main reason i purchased the kindle, this way i could give it to my daughter and not have to worry about her getting into system files or getting into anything that sheshouldn't be seeing as well as making it easy for her to grow with the best parental controls offered without competition. This combined with an easily buyable foam case makes this by far the most toddler/child/kid friendly.<br />****one downside of free time that i have found; is that you cannot give the &#34;free time&#34; app access to your uploaded videos; i wanted to give my daughter access to some movies that i had on my computer, i uploaded them to the device but you can not give the freetime app access to those videos. i suppose it has to do with the fact that videos cannot be categorized so they don't give it access or if it is just overlooked because many people don't know how to directly upload videos to the devices.<br /><br />App store: (Fair): This is another possible weakness of the kindle; the reason being is that there are not as many apps available for the kindles as as the google play store or the apple app stores. One thing to note is that the kindle operating system is much newer than android and apple so this is normal. just like not that long ago there were more apps for apple than android, however today that is reversed. Currently there are not as many apps that i want to put for my daughter (kindle only has endless alphabet, where android and apple have all 3 endless alphabet, words, numbers)<br /><br />overview: I really like the kindle fire that I purchased, it is a great tablet that my daughter can grow into and use for years to come without me constantly looking over her shoulder or locking her in and out of specific apps (iOS guided access). There are many things that amazon can improve, however it is a great system for kids and for reading.<br /><br />*Caution; if you are looking for a tablet to organize your life with productivity/organization apps, i highly recommend you look some place else. the kindle is EXCELLENT for kids, and parental controls.",2015-08-18,1,"1"

Two lengthy customer service phone calls since I got it in May! The old one was a gift in December 2012. I had used and loved the Kindle app on my iPod Touch for 3 years and was debating a Kindle Fire vs an iPad when a friend made the decision for me. I'm mostly a reader, with a few games and some Internet surfing, maybe a few old TV shows; I used it a lot and bought a LOT of book content because it was much easier to read on the Kindle than the Touch or my iPhone. Until 2.25 years in, this past spring, when the screen started flickering and then breaking up totally. I could not find a solution online and decided to buy a new Fire when it was on sale around Mother's Day. First problem: my books were not all showing in the Cloud. That was lengthy call #1 and included the CS rep saying that I would have to upload each book individually because some had updates (!). Today was lengthy call #2 because the Home icon opened to what looked like the App tab (but wasn't, because it included some books that hadn't been opened in months). That required a factory reset and again, hey, not all of my book content was showing in the Cloud! The CS pushed them out remotely. Not what's supposed to happen! I expect that this one will fail around the 2-year mark, too, and then I will be done with the Fire.",2015-08-17,0,"-1"

Speakers sound very nice, clear without any distortion and the double speakers really made watching movies or listening to music a much more enjoyable experience. I'm going to save up and buy my mother one for Christmas, she's 60 and technically challenged but I believe Kindles are much easier to use than most tablets I have tried (as far as a easy to learn use of a tablet).

I got the white version and that was a big mistake because it got dirty very fast like within the first day of having it.

This tablet also does not have google play store built in and it runs on android. I would have kept this tablet for watching movies, playing clash of clans, and probably for reading E books but I didn't have the money. I also own a Microsoft surface 2 which I already use for watching Netflix and it has a bigger screen than this one.

Does what I want it to do, no complaints.  My only wish is that I wish it was more customizeable as far as wallpapers and lock screens.  P.S.  As info - I saved Pulp Fiction and World War Z from Prime video offline viewing and I now only have 2gigs left, roughly.  Everything else is a few apps downloaded and the rest of the system memory.",2015-08-13,1,"1"

The software could use some work and the app availability is somewhat less than on Google Play, but for what it is I'm ok with it.  Where I am actually disappointed (hence the 4 star rating and not 5) is the battery life.  This tablet only lasts 3 or 4 hours on a charge.  It should last 7+ hours to keep up with competitors.  It also burns through battery life when left in suspension (tablet on, screen off), so leave it plugged in when not in use.  When it goes on sale, it is a good value.

But there are also tons of cons for it which is making me anticipate another tablet for actual internet usage and save this strictly for eReading. Biggest disappointment is the fact that it doesn't connect to the Google Play store and seriously hinders which apps I can add. Seems most of the apps I want/like are not available from the Amazon store which renders most of my non-reading usage useless. Second biggest disappointment is how poorly this connects to wi-fi. It takes forever sometimes to connect to my home wi-fi and it drops way too easily. Say I'm connected but I step away from it for an hour, when I come back to it, I'll have to spend another 5-10 minutes trying to get it to reconnect again which is seriously annoying.<br /><br />However, as an eReader, I enjoy the different backgrounds and fonts that suit my likes, as well as the number of books I can load to it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a colored eReader, this gets a plus but for anyone who wants to use this as a respectable tablet too, I'd get something else for apps.",2015-08-12,0,"-1"

I guess my chief complaint is the lock screen, I don't want to see your dumb ads for apps and products I don't want Amazon, I already purchased your tablet leave me alone. Another big problem I have is the amazon app store itself. Maybe having an android for years spoiled me because the google play store is by far superior, if you use play store or Apple app store then switching to amazon app store will drive you insane. Not only do they not have the games and apps I love and use, they bombard you with sub quality apps and games and  they all heavily utilize in game purchasing (maybe just the ones I checked out and possibly a problem with the phone game and app business in general but still upset me). The last big point I have to make is the lack of customization allowed. You basically can't customize anything, as I mentioned before the lock screen is always some ad amazon is throwing in your face, but the home screen also cannot be changed, just a black screen with your app icons there. I really wish, like my phone and my brothers tablet, you could add your own pictures or even change the app icons themselves, but alas I'm stuck with this sub par tablet.

I started out with the reader when they first came out.  A year later my husband bought me a Kindle Fire for Christmas.  It died in the hot tub (husband didn't see that it was sitting on the open cover) so I got it replaced with the warranty.  After that one my best friend got one and put it on my account so we can share our books (we like the same kind of books).  Recently I bought another one (this one) and gave my older one to my 10 year old grandson for his birthday.  He loves it as much as I love mine.  I log onto the local library and borrow books. I use it to go online and locate whatever I need. I use it to watch shows while I walk on my treadmill.  It uses Wifi only but you can find Wifi almost anywhere nowadays so it is rarely a problem.  I take my Kindle with me everywhere I go and don't know what I would do without it.",2015-08-11,1,"1"

On the new version, there is no light so you need to continue to check.  Also, when the Kindle is on sleep mode advertisements rolling across the screen.  I'm not a fan!<br />When watching a video ---WOW! what a difference from the original.  It makes all of the other imperfections meaningless.  The sound, color and graphics are great.<br />Other than the few negatives, I do like the new edition but wished I would have gotten a larger screen.  My next purchase will be a larger screen.

Worked great in any light and especially well on the beach or by the pool.  Just needed a small book light to read the Touch in bed at night.  The Fire solved the reading in the dark problem as the backlit screen brightness could easily be adjusted.  For all other reading environments, however, the Fire just wasn't as good as the Touch and glare is a big problem (unless you buy an add-on screen cover which I haven't yet tried because it's annoying that you have to pay for all these add-ons (including the Fire cover)).

It drains just sitting there doing nothing.<br />-sound issues: it makes an obnoxious noise in my headphones when connecting to things that play sound and for the longest time i was having problems with the volume fluctuating so drastically i could either barely hear or it was blowing out my ears. I was constantly having to adjust volume. Amazons answer: bluetooth headphones with microphones aren't compatible with the new kindle fire. That's all that exists.

It's cute, light, the color is great, I even prefer the official amazon case to the official iPad case for my iPad 4. That being said.....this tablet is utter garbage.  The UI doesn't bother me, I can configure it the way I want with &#34;collections&#34; and the like.  The screen is bright and of good quality, and the Dolby speakers really do sound great, better than my iPad.  However, the compliments end here.<br /><br />What grinds my gears about this tablet:<br /><br />- Buggy as hell.  From apps not updating or loading properly to magazines loading and then disappearing, this OS is FULL of bugs that &#34;updates&#34; do not seem to solve.  I have had to delete, de-register, and restore this tablet FOUR TIMES since purchasing it last November, and Amazon has had to send me a replacement because the original device would not allow me to add my Gmail no matter what I tried.<br />- Instant Video:  For the past month I get a &#34;license error&#34; every time I try to play an instant video, and I am a prime member and have been since 2010.  Isn't the whole point behind this amazon tablet is so it can play amazon content?  I've given up trying to fix it and use Netflix instead, as the customer service is outsourced and completely inept.<br />- Lack of customization:  Not being able to add a background image to the home screen is a colossal error.<br />- Lack of Google Play Services:  Speaking of colossal mistakes, not including google play on this device is a HUGE mistake.  Whatever the reason is, get over it and include Google.  Not being able to have chrome, gmail, etc is just plain dumb and cripples an already crippled device.<br />- Lack of apps: another well discussed subject.  The major ones are here, but many are not, as discussed above.<br /><br />All in all very much a half baked device that could have been a lot better.",2015-08-07,0,"-1"

I've never used any android type device so I was worried that it would be difficult to use. But it wasn't! The various screens and menus take a bit of time to get used to, but the learning curve isn't that difficult.<br /><br />The build of the kindle is quite sturdy. While it is made of plastic, it definitely feels more durable than an other tablets. I'm not afraid to take it outdoors. There are tons of apps available in the amazon app store as well - all the social networking apps and popular games are there. The performance is great, apps run well and the integration with my amazon account is great, especially as a prime member it is easy to access and download digital content.<br /><br />The reason the kindle loses a star: battery life and responsiveness. I've found that the kindle sometimes doesn't hold a charge for long periods of time when not in use. A minor detail, but worth noting. On some of the interfaces as well, there is a bit of lag time between when I touch and when the device responds. It is still fairly quick, but it is noticeable. This isn't always a problem though.<br /><br />Overall, especially for the price, I think the Kindle Fire HD 7 is a great entry-level tablet!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",2015-08-07,1,"1"

The last one to die is out of warranty, and Amazon's only solution was to offer me a supposedly &#34;very discounted rate&#34; on a replacement, which ended up being $25 off of the ludicrous prices on their refurbished and outdated outlet offerings.

Not one of the 6 or 7 different support techs I worked with could even point me to a site with troubleshooting options to re-install the factory software so that I could determine whether there is an actual hardware issue with this disposable tablet. They freely admitted that they don't even bother trying to repair these devices, and that replacement was my only option.

While it is true that the advertisements will only appear before you put in your pin, I really would have preferred a way to set my own backgrounds like EVERY OTHER DEVICE I OWN.<br /><br />Insult to injury? You will have to pay $15.00 extra dollars for the luxury of no ads.

I'm impressed with the quality for such a great (promotional) price. The advertisements truly are non-intrusive, so all but the most ad-averse probably don't need to spring for the extra money to get rid of them. I'm not giving it five stars due to two drawbacks that really irk me -- the first is the limited number of downloadable options on Amazon Prime. The second drawback is that this can't be connected to a TV, at least not without WiFi (and the specific reason I bought this was for watching videos in a remote location where I don't have a WiFi connection -- in locations where I do have WiFi, there are already other entertainment options).

The Kindle that does work (mine the larger HDX) is slow and lags a bit, which was a problem with all three Kindles.

The other 3 GBs are taken up by their software and the system.And every time you wake it up, there's an advertisement to buy something on the screen. Oh, and the fact that there is no way to expand the memory is also pretty handicapping if you like to take along movies to watch when you're not on wi-fi. I should have read closer to see that there was no memory card slot because I probably would have passed on this, even with the Black Friday sale discount, had I realized there was no way to extend the memory, short of putting things on the cloud, which won't work if you don't have a wi-fi connection.",2015-08-02,0,"-1"
