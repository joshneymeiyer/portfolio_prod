Before the update it would automatically load whichever profile was loaded when it shut down.  This change is causing a good deal of frustration with the toddler who used to be able to power it on and get into his profile with very little assistance.<br />Also, I purchased the full version of some preschool apps, but they cannot be used in the child's profile because it does not allow for in-app purchases.  While Amazon was willing to refund my money for the apps, their first response was to allow the child to use the apps in the parent's profile.  I felt that defeated the purpose of parental controls.  My husband and I use a Samsung tablet.  When we upgrade our tablet we're going to give our old one to the kids because the Samsung Kid's Mode app is more user-friendly--it allows in-app purchases to be used in Kid's mode and if the tablet shuts down in kid's mode, it reboots in kid's mode.","2015-08-25",0,-1,"OTHER"

I bought it to replace a Nexus 7 (original gen) that was getting on in years.  That was a mistake.  The Fire HD 7, while providing a nice screen, is very frustrating to deal with when you're coming from a more versatile system.  To be clear, the only things I really do on these devices is: 1) read books; 2) watch movies/shows on channel specific or general apps like Hulu, Netflix, Showtime, etc.; 3) occasionally browse the web; and 4) occasionally play games.  For these simple purposes, the Fire is okay, but barely.  Because it's a closed system, you can only download apps from Amazon, who doesn't have the full complement of apps available on Google Play.  You can root the Fire, but that's way more work than should be necessary for something like this.<br /><br />Then there's the battery life, which is horrible.  I now rarely use the Fire because it always needs to be charged.  I can have it fully charged, read something on it for 30 minutes, put it down for a day, and come back to find it's out of juice.  My old Nexus 7 doesn't even eat battery like that!  That makes this thing an occasional device to use after my Nexus runs down.  Added to that, despite its use of the universal Micro USB, it only seems to charge on its own cord, which makes meet think it's poorly constructed to boot.<br /><br />Bottom line: I regret wasting my money on this and will not be buying again, or recommending to anyone else to purchase unless it's super cheap.","2015-08-20",0,-1,"Battery life"

I'm mostly a reader, with a few games and some Internet surfing, maybe a few old TV shows; I used it a lot and bought a LOT of book content because it was much easier to read on the Kindle than the Touch or my iPhone. Until 2.25 years in, this past spring, when the screen started flickering and then breaking up totally. I could not find a solution online and decided to buy a new Fire when it was on sale around Mother's Day. First problem: my books were not all showing in the Cloud. That was lengthy call #1 and included the CS rep saying that I would have to upload each book individually because some had updates (!). Today was lengthy call #2 because the Home icon opened to what looked like the App tab (but wasn't, because it included some books that hadn't been opened in months). That required a factory reset and again, hey, not all of my book content was showing in the Cloud! The CS pushed them out remotely. Not what's supposed to happen! I expect that this one will fail around the 2-year mark, too, and then I will be done with the Fire.","2015-08-17",0,-1,"Software bugs"

Seems most of the apps I want/like are not available from the Amazon store which renders most of my non-reading usage useless. Second biggest disappointment is how poorly this connects to wi-fi. It takes forever sometimes to connect to my home wi-fi and it drops way too easily. Say I'm connected but I step away from it for an hour, when I come back to it, I'll have to spend another 5-10 minutes trying to get it to reconnect again which is seriously annoying.<br /><br />However, as an eReader, I enjoy the different backgrounds and fonts that suit my likes, as well as the number of books I can load to it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a colored eReader, this gets a plus but for anyone who wants to use this as a respectable tablet too, I'd get something else for apps.","2015-08-12",0,-1,"Google Play"

I guess my chief complaint is the lock screen, I don't want to see your dumb ads for apps and products I don't want Amazon, I already purchased your tablet leave me alone. Another big problem I have is the amazon app store itself. Maybe having an android for years spoiled me because the google play store is by far superior, if you use play store or Apple app store then switching to amazon app store will drive you insane. Not only do they not have the games and apps I love and use, they bombard you with sub quality apps and games and  they all heavily utilize in game purchasing (maybe just the ones I checked out and possibly a problem with the phone game and app business in general but still upset me). The last big point I have to make is the lack of customization allowed. You basically can't customize anything, as I mentioned before the lock screen is always some ad amazon is throwing in your face, but the home screen also cannot be changed, just a black screen with your app icons there. I really wish, like my phone and my brothers tablet, you could add your own pictures or even change the app icons themselves, but alas I'm stuck with this sub par tablet. Anyways, sorry I rambled but I needed to get that all off my chest. Definitely going to get an Apple or Samsung next time.","2015-08-12",0,-1,"Ads"

Worked great in any light and especially well on the beach or by the pool.  Just needed a small book light to read the Touch in bed at night.  The Fire solved the reading in the dark problem as the backlit screen brightness could easily be adjusted.  For all other reading environments, however, the Fire just wasn't as good as the Touch and glare is a big problem (unless you buy an add-on screen cover which I haven't yet tried because it's annoying that you have to pay for all these add-ons (including the Fire cover)).

It drains just sitting there doing nothing.<br />-sound issues: it makes an obnoxious noise in my headphones when connecting to things that play sound and for the longest time i was having problems with the volume fluctuating so drastically i could either barely hear or it was blowing out my ears. I was constantly having to adjust volume. Amazons answer: bluetooth headphones with microphones aren't compatible with the new kindle fire. That's all that exists.

The last one to die is out of warranty, and Amazon's only solution was to offer me a supposedly &#34;very discounted rate&#34; on a replacement, which ended up being $25 off of the ludicrous prices on their refurbished and outdated outlet offerings. The best deal they offered me was still $30 more than I paid for the original kindle almost 2 years ago when it was new tech. Not one of the 6 or 7 different support techs I worked with could even point me to a site with troubleshooting options to re-install the factory software so that I could determine whether there is an actual hardware issue with this disposable tablet. They freely admitted that they don't even bother trying to repair these devices, and that replacement was my only option. No ability to replace a battery, no established way to re-install the factory default software, and a troubleshooting script taken from Dogbert - &#34;Shut up and reboot.&#34;  Very disappointed, Amazon.","2015-08-06",0,-1,"Build quality"
