I don't take advantage of all the things it can do.  But some things are confusing like how apps are loaded and then given to other profiles.  Each app uses space and must be loaded to each profile.

I was once given a ProntoTec 7&#34; tablet and it was so useless, I was put off on tablets altogether. But the Kindle Fire actually works, and works well. It's quick, responds accurately to my touch, and makes an excellent Kindle ebook reader. I've been reading like crazy since I got it. It also performs fine for simple things like checking email and getting notices from my gmail calendar. For other uses, like games, or anything that involves text input, I'd rather be at my desktop with a big screen and good keyboard. That's not a knock on the Fire, it's just my preference. The point is that I haven't been downloading apps and using them. Other than sitting in my easy chair and reading, I can't think of anything I'd rather do on a tablet than on a desktop PC.<br /><br />I once read that Amazon sells the Kindles at below cost in the hope the buyers will spend money on the books, movies, videos, subscription services, etc. I don't know if that is true, but really, a tablet isn't of any value without the content, so any review of the Kindle Fire must address that. I have enjoyed my free trials of both Amazon Prime and Kindle Unlimited (KU). Both are paid services that give you privileges and &#34;free&#34; stuff (that you are paying for with your subscription). I have decided to cancel both at the end of the free trial period next week. I'm not saying they aren't worth it. I've found a couple of good TV series on Amazon Prime (Bosch, Sneaky Pete) and read some good books from KU. But after checking my reading wish list against the KU offerings, I find that most of them are available on Kindle for money, but are not in the KU or Prime catalog. So I would still have to pay for them. Similarly, the best movies on Amazon video are not included in Prime. So despite paying for these free downloads and streams through the subscription, I'd still pay full retail on top of that. I don't see the point of the subscriptionif that holds true. I've downloaded the Overdrive app so I can get some of these ebooks from my local library. I'll try that for awhile. I'll also check out the free books that are always being offered on Amazon and see how good or bad they are. I may go back to KU after I've compared that experience. And I may just start buying Kindle books without the subscriptions services. I really like the Kindle for book reading.<br /><br />Your needs and tastes may vary. I just urge you to consider how you're going to use the Kindle. The Fire does not allow access to the Google app store downloads. You have to get your apps from Amazon's store. Many are free, but you can't necessarily get the ones you would like that are available for Android phones and tablets. Also, this model is wi-fi only, so it's not connected using the cell service data plans. That works for me because I don't take it out of the house, but you may want to spring for something more expensive if you need to be always connected.","2015-08-30",1,1,"Reading"

My granddaughter is now the proud owner of the second.  I find I like to have two Kindles on hand, so I never have to be tethered to a charger while I try to quickly (and sometimes uncomfortably) read the last chapter of a good book.  The phone app is okay in a reading emergency, but I find it is not quite heavy enough to wake me up when it hits me in the face if I have fallen asleep while reading ;)  So, my newest Fire gets 5 stars because finally the designers were thinking like actual Kindle users by putting the power button at the top of the device instead of at the bottom where it was too easy to accidentally power cycle.  The charging port is at the top as well which is nice.  Otherwise, this device is pretty much the same as the last one.  Good job Amazon!","2015-08-27",1,1,"Reading"

(bigger number next to GB  is better as well. )<br /><br />2. No youtube/ google play services: while some may like this, and some may not, I do wish for google play services but, I also wish for amazon to keep it's current os look. HOWEVER: you can run .apks (android apps) on this device, as long as you're willing to accept that amazon WILL NOT HELP YOU should an android .apk causes internal system damage to your fire.<br /><br />3. keyboard lag: Remember the 200 MBs of RAM that you are left to fart around with? I forgot to factor in keyboard usage,  after keyboard usage, 100 MB, and this causes some slow downs, in terms of the keyboard, and some other amazon apps and services.<br /><br />and these are really the only complaints I have with the device, on the scale of dream about it, play with a store display unit, or buy it?

Logging on from the lock screen is also sluggish where after i put in my pass pin there is a good 1 second lag where i am often unsure if there was an &#34;enter&#34; or &#34;ok&#34; button i forgot to press. Performance within apps are no problem, once an app is loaded it runs smoothly from books, to games, to movies.<br /><br />-Battery: (Fair) battery is tied to hardware but warrants its own section Battery life leaves much to be desired, my daughter plays on apps and watches videos (too young to read yet) and the battery will last for ~4-5 hours, which is plenty if you are using it in the house but if you are going to be flying then it can fall a little short sometimes.<br /><br />-Kindle operating system (OS): (Excellent/poor):<br /><br />-- Part 1 [main system]: (poor) it doesn't run like anything that most people are used to. I have used and am very comfortable with both iOS (apple) and Android. the main idea with those is to have a few apps on the bottom with a library in the middle. the kindle makes it different where there are large &#34;recent history&#34; apps which side scroll in the middle. then on the bottom there is another row of &#34;favorites&#34; on the bottom. with a swipe up from the bottom tray you can access all of the apps you choose to have there, (like a hidden home screen). The search function is also mainly geared towards finding things on amazon and makes anything that is on the store come up first.<br /><br />--Part 2 [Free time]: (Excellent) this is the main reason i purchased the kindle, this way i could give it to my daughter and not have to worry about her getting into system files or getting into anything that sheshouldn't be seeing as well as making it easy for her to grow with the best parental controls offered without competition. This combined with an easily buyable foam case makes this by far the most toddler/child/kid friendly.<br />****one downside of free time that i have found; is that you cannot give the &#34;free time&#34; app access to your uploaded videos; i wanted to give my daughter access to some movies that i had on my computer, i uploaded them to the device but you can not give the freetime app access to those videos. i suppose it has to do with the fact that videos cannot be categorized so they don't give it access or if it is just overlooked because many people don't know how to directly upload videos to the devices.<br /><br />App store: (Fair): This is another possible weakness of the kindle; the reason being is that there are not as many apps available for the kindles as as the google play store or the apple app stores. One thing to note is that the kindle operating system is much newer than android and apple so this is normal. just like not that long ago there were more apps for apple than android, however today that is reversed. Currently there are not as many apps that i want to put for my daughter (kindle only has endless alphabet, where android and apple have all 3 endless alphabet, words, numbers)<br /><br />overview: I really like the kindle fire that I purchased, it is a great tablet that my daughter can grow into and use for years to come without me constantly looking over her shoulder or locking her in and out of specific apps (iOS guided access). There are many things that amazon can improve, however it is a great system for kids and for reading.<br /><br />*Caution; if you are looking for a tablet to organize your life with productivity/organization apps, i highly recommend you look some place else. the kindle is EXCELLENT for kids, and parental controls.","2015-08-18",1,1,"Speed"

I set up a profile for them and can then decide what specific books, apps, etc. that I want them to have access to. There is one little quirk in which sometimes application which I have downloaded on my profile and selected on my child's profile will appear on the child profile but they don't have access to them (an 'x' is present in the icon).

Delivered on time, box could bang all over inside though so adding air packs or something to keep it packed tight and padded would be a lot nicer. It made me worry if it could have been damaged in shipping. It works fine though so far :) Takes beautiful crisp pictures, little heavy for me to hold and a bit large for my hands compared to the smaller original Kindle Fire, but that's just because I have finger joint issues and small hands. Speakers sound very nice, clear without any distortion and the double speakers really made watching movies or listening to music a much more enjoyable experience. I'm going to save up and buy my mother one for Christmas, she's 60 and technically challenged but I believe Kindles are much easier to use than most tablets I have tried (as far as a easy to learn use of a tablet). I bought mine through the FingerHut credit rebuilding store/website. Amazon handled the purchase/shipping of it though.

This tablet has a nice screen with the high pixel density and preformed tasks fast, however it has advertisements built into it. The speakers are truly amazing and the best I have ever listened to on a tablet. It is kinda thick but feels good in the hand. I got the white version and that was a big mistake because it got dirty very fast like within the first day of having it. I really liked this tablet but I ended up returning it because I did not use it frequently and also decided to put the $89 towards paying my credit card bill from buying an apple watch. This tablet also does not have google play store built in and it runs on android. I would have kept this tablet for watching movies, playing clash of clans, and probably for reading E books but I didn't have the money. I also own a Microsoft surface 2 which I already use for watching Netflix and it has a bigger screen than this one. The kindle was overall pretty cool just don't buy the white version, and be warned that advertisements will appear on the locked screen.

Does what I want it to do, no complaints.  My only wish is that I wish it was more customizeable as far as wallpapers and lock screens.  P.S.

The software could use some work and the app availability is somewhat less than on Google Play, but for what it is I'm ok with it.  Where I am actually disappointed (hence the 4 star rating and not 5) is the battery life.  This tablet only lasts 3 or 4 hours on a charge.  It should last 7+ hours to keep up with competitors.  It also burns through battery life when left in suspension (tablet on, screen off), so leave it plugged in when not in use.  When it goes on sale, it is a good value.

I started out with the reader when they first came out.  A year later my husband bought me a Kindle Fire for Christmas.  It died in the hot tub (husband didn't see that it was sitting on the open cover) so I got it replaced with the warranty.  After that one my best friend got one and put it on my account so we can share our books (we like the same kind of books).  Recently I bought another one (this one) and gave my older one to my 10 year old grandson for his birthday.  He loves it as much as I love mine.  I log onto the local library and borrow books. I use it to go online and locate whatever I need. I use it to watch shows while I walk on my treadmill.  It uses Wifi only but you can find Wifi almost anywhere nowadays so it is rarely a problem.  I take my Kindle with me everywhere I go and don't know what I would do without it.","2015-08-11",1,1,"Reading"

I like this version, but there are few changes I don't like.  One thing is on the original Fire when it was charging you could tell when it was fully charged by seeing the light go green.  On the new version, there is no light so you need to continue to check.  Also, when the Kindle is on sleep mode advertisements rolling across the screen.  I'm not a fan!<br />When watching a video ---WOW! what a difference from the original.  It makes all of the other imperfections meaningless.  The sound, color and graphics are great.<br />Other than the few negatives, I do like the new edition but wished I would have gotten a larger screen.  My next purchase will be a larger screen.

I had to wait a full month from the time I ordered it until it was delivered. All the colors were out of stock. Really? Such a popular product is not in stock? And I ordered mine reight before the hyped &#34;Prime Day,&#34; so I wonder how many tried to order and also had to wait.<br /><br />Features that I like:<br />The &#34;top mount&#34; power cable<br />The cleaner look of the screen<br />The resolution--very sharp and clear<br />E-mail much easier to read<br />Internet navigation is much better and easier<br />The selection of different progress indicators while reading an e-book--time, relative place, or even &#34;page xx of xxx&#34;<br />Firefly, even thought I don't think I'll use if much--it's just fun to play with<br /><br />Features that I dislike:<br />The power cable is too short to use easily--got to be in a low seat right next to an outlet to connect while using the Fire<br />The incessant ads and &#34;suggestions, until I finally found out how to hide them<br />The really poor help guides--very little information; mostly it's trial and error to learn the new-to-me features<br /><br />I have not used the camera yet. Again, info in &#34;Help&#34; is severely lacking and I have not yet gotten around to the trial and error with that feature.<br /><br />So, because of the long wait and a few negative issues, I only rated it as 4 stars rather than five.","2015-08-07",1,1,"Display"

I've never used any android type device so I was worried that it would be difficult to use. But it wasn't! The various screens and menus take a bit of time to get used to, but the learning curve isn't that difficult.<br /><br />The build of the kindle is quite sturdy. While it is made of plastic, it definitely feels more durable than an other tablets. I'm not afraid to take it outdoors. There are tons of apps available in the amazon app store as well - all the social networking apps and popular games are there. The performance is great, apps run well and the integration with my amazon account is great, especially as a prime member it is easy to access and download digital content.<br /><br />The reason the kindle loses a star: battery life and responsiveness. I've found that the kindle sometimes doesn't hold a charge for long periods of time when not in use. A minor detail, but worth noting. On some of the interfaces as well, there is a bit of lag time between when I touch and when the device responds. It is still fairly quick, but it is noticeable. This isn't always a problem though.<br /><br />Overall, especially for the price, I think the Kindle Fire HD 7 is a great entry-level tablet!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.","2015-08-07",1,1,"Ease"

I was pleasantly surprised by exactly how much I could do with my new Kindle Fire and I'm still learning things all the time. It was really easy to set up and get running. It recognized my network immediately (which is a first for any device!) and was completely plug-n-play. I do wish is that it had come with a longer USB cord and headphones. I'm just mentioning it so if you are buying this item you'll know that you may need to order a cord and earbuds at the same time. Definitely not a deal breaker!<br /><br />So why not a full five stars?<br /><br />If you are easily annoyed, you might want to skip the discount if you buy the Kindle with advertising on the lock screen. While it is true that the advertisements will only appear before you put in your pin, I really would have preferred a way to set my own backgrounds like EVERY OTHER DEVICE I OWN.<br /><br />Insult to injury? You will have to pay $15.00 extra dollars for the luxury of no ads.

I've been advised where to find the users guide.

I'm impressed with the quality for such a great (promotional) price. The advertisements truly are non-intrusive, so all but the most ad-averse probably don't need to spring for the extra money to get rid of them. I'm not giving it five stars due to two drawbacks that really irk me -- the first is the limited number of downloadable options on Amazon Prime. The second drawback is that this can't be connected to a TV, at least not without WiFi (and the specific reason I bought this was for watching videos in a remote location where I don't have a WiFi connection -- in locations where I do have WiFi, there are already other entertainment options). So, it's a good option for one person to watch a video, but not so great for two or more people.","2015-08-02",1,1,"OTHER"

I loved everything about it!!!! Than after awhile the battery stopped holding a charge, so I called Amazon and talked to a very nice representative, she sent me a new one and I sent the broken one back!! I was 37 at this time and I cried like a baby. Than I broke that one in the car when it was between the seats, kids lifted chair up and down, forgot it was there.....Oooops!!! Than I bought a refurbished one on E-Bay and the battery went after two months!!!! Than July 22nd of this year my wonderful Mother and awesome younger Sister bought me the Kindle fire HD 7&#34; for my Birthday.....once again, turning 39....I cried!!! I love this product and would most definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a great tablet!!! Thank You Amazon, Rebecca","2015-08-02",1,1,"Battery"
