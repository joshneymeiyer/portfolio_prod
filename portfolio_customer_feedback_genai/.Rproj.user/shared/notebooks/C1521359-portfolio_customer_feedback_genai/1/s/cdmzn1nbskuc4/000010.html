After trying everything to fix the problem the pictures are not good.","just wish when you buy the kindle from a retailer you could see the settings to show your memory and version instead of having to go to amazon website","I would buy one wit more space. 8 GB is not enough even a two yr old (for whom it was bought)","Bought it for the additional camera and photo app. Had ordered blue but received black.","The camera resolution is not very clear.","the Fire HD 7 is very nice, but the directions for use that came with it are terrible for someone that has no idea how to use it. Is there somewhere to get information o how to use it? Need help.","Great product, but it does take a bit of time to adjust to. Coming from iOS, some of the displays aren't intuitive, like the home screen that shows only some of the apps unless you select one of the categories from the top and the carousel, which I believe shows you the most recent used apps but shows me books, too. I wish there was a way to categorize apps within the home screen, because it's quite messy. Silk is not my favorite browser, and I don't like how I have to go to the homes screen to check something on another app (i.e- Goodreads) and then have to return to Silk to search, if that makes sense. Essentially, I think there needs to be an easier way to toggle between apps. However, the Kindle does it's job, so no big deal.","antiglare protector screen does not work well, the millions of free songs never seem to be the ones I want... my taste runs to the classic rock 70's and 80's and there is a cost to almost every selection I made... movies same story.  I will probably cancel Amazon Prime for the same reason  if my experience doesn't change in the next few weeks.  Otherwise the hardware is everything I expected.","was so used to my previous Kindle which allowed me to have all my unread books on the carousel and all read books in favorites.  LOVED this feature. Wish it was on this Fire HD7","Couldn't get all the app I excepted..sorry!","I bought this because my 2013 Kindle HD 7 with 32GB RAM crashed.  The Amazon Tech told me do a Hard Boot and I held the power for 20 seconds, release and turned it on. Garbage screen and nothing.so I was transferred to 2nd tier tech support. She did nothing but sell me THIS Kindle with 8GB RAM.  It came with a 2015 version of a book i already had.  The book said Kindle have problems if you let the batteries too low.  The book said to WAIT 10 seconds.  I tried that and the Startup screen looked no better than before. I had it plugged into my Windows 7 pc.  A short time later I opened the case and it was NORMAL.  Amazon Tech did not tell me to WAIT 10 seconds. The keyboard on the new Kindle is hard to use. It is smaller but has more functions.  My first kindle IS dead But it's content CAN be accessed by my PC.  So what I now own is a new Kindle HD 7 AND a 22GB Flash drive. Slower because it is Android.","I purchased these for my kids. However, it appears 8GB is not much. It would be nice if we could add a sds card or something to increase the memory.","Nice display, fast processing,<br />Dislike- can't get lot of apps I enjoy on ipod","We have Sling on our Amazon Fire television.  We thought that since the Fire tablets were promoted as working with the Fire t.v., that we could watch Sling on this tablet; however, that is not the case.  We are unhappy that we cannot watch Sling on this.  We think that as long as Amazon is promoting these tablets as working with the Fire T.V., then all the things that can be done on the Fire T.V. should work on the tablet.  Otherwise, we like reading Kindle books, watching Amazon Instant videos, reading the Washington Post, playing games, and doing things on the internet on this tablet.  We were just unhappy about the Sling.","Not all I thought it would be","The screen is just beautiful, case is more challenging to use.  Not impressed.  I wish there was someone to talk to with some probems that I have.<br />It would have made the whole experience easy and so much better and maybe five stars would show up.  Right now its still a hit and miss.  So I won't get the whole positive experience and that's a shame.","This was my favorite Kindle of all time and it finally died.  I am not happy with the replacement of a Paperwhite.","Very nice.  Now, if I can just figure out how to use it.","It wasn't useful to me for the reason I wanted to use it for.","This is great. Love the speed and clarity.  Quality of the video player is amazing.  This does not work with Google Play which to me is the only downfall, but is a major one.","My Kindle freezes up and I am constantly having to power it down and back up again.  When I clicked on the &#34;return&#34; button in hopes of exchanging it, it said I was too late (2 weeks too late).  This is my 4th Kindle - I used to love them, but this one is frustrating me to no end.  Perhaps it's time to become an Apple user after all - at least they stand behind their product.  Second Entry:  I emailed Amazon and they took care of me!  Shrew!  I would've been extremely disappointed in them if they had left me high-and-dry, but they didn't!  THANK YOU, AMAZON!!!!","Love love love .  I got it for my daughter .  She loves it .  My son has the iPod .  And I feel like I wasted so much money on it .  I should've got the Kindle fire too","Excellent value.  Limited phone apps.  Does not have TWC Phone 2 GO was disappointing..It would be nice to be able to use Google play apps without voiding the warranty. The email application is flaky. You never know if it will remove emails from the server upon downloads or not. Deleting them from the tablet may or may not delete them from the server. You can only delete mail messages one at a time.  If you use multiple devices you run this will result in mismanaging your email.  As a result I deleted my email account.","Have used it some but my main purpose is to use in with the Echo. It works like I expected but was hoping to use it for multiple lists not JUST Shopping and To-do lists. The battery duration is a little less than I expected. It was advertised at about 8 hours. Mine is more like 6 hours. The documentation (Manuals and help) leave much to be desired.","Hard to see screen out in day light, have to tilt, there is still a glare, tuff to read by the pool.","had problems adjusting font and screen color  still working on that problem","I like the actual Amazon Fire.  What I didn't like was not getting it until 3 weeks after I ordered.  Also, having to on-line chat and then talk to Customer Service to even get started.  I could not connect to Wi-fi.  After several conversations, it was determined the problem was the Kindle had the wrong time and date.  Once this was changed, I was able to connect.  It was frustrating.  The Kindle seems very user friendly.  I like the touch screen much better than the keyboard on the old one I had.","Still not much help for dry eye ....","I lose my place and can't retrieve.","I need help setting it up.  Stuff in Fire HD 7 is useless for setting up.<br />I don't want to view a stupid movie video; I want to set up the Kindle<br />so that this legally blind can READ my books!","Don't like the cord","I do not like the on off button.  It is a good thing that I have nails.","A good tablet but at times, it freezes up. I've already had to reset it when the carousel disappeared and I could not get the appstore, list of apps, etc open from the top menu.","Perfect size for a travel tablet. Can't seem to get my SLING TV app from android to download.","Nice unit all good disappointed it won't work for chrome cast","Great picture, tends to freeze up at times . Some apps I wouldn't have picked like Wall Street Journal come pre loaded for some reason. ? Don't like the commercial that appears every time I log in?!","Too much ads","Love all graphics.  Too many commercial pop_ups.","I really like this tablet. But it doesn't allow some game downloads which is really inconvienant. No google, no gmail. Not exactly what I wanted but it does get the job done.","Needs detailed instruction on how to use. After paying over $100.00 for an item and then you must purchase detailed instruction is a big turn off. I can get detailed instruction for a $10 item but not for this. A bit insane!"],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>review_body<\/th>\n      <th>sentiment<\/th>\n      <th>sentiment_2<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[2,3]},{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"review_body","targets":1},{"name":"sentiment","targets":2},{"name":"sentiment_2","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100],"rowCallback":"function(row, data, displayNum, displayIndex, dataIndex) {\n}"}},"evals":["options.rowCallback"],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
