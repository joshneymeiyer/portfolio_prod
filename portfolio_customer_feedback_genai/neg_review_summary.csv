"1","Top 5 reasons for negative reviews (with brief explanations):

- Performance instability: Frequent freezing, crashes, and slow response make the tablet feel unreliable and frustrating to use.

- Ad-heavy experience: Constant ads and full-screen “offers” on startup or across the UI; many users dislike paying to remove ads or feel marketed to too aggressively.

- Limited app ecosystem / Google gap: Inability to install Google apps or access Google Play; heavy reliance on Amazon’s store leads to missing apps and less flexibility.

- Insufficient storage and memory: 8–16 GB often isn’t enough once the OS and preloaded apps are counted; no microSD expansion means users quickly run out of space.

- Battery life and charging issues: Short battery life, fast drains, and charging problems are repeatedly cited as major detractors."
